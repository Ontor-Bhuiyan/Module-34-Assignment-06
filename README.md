## Create a README file to answer the following question-

1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
answer: 1)Var: A var has a global scope
        if declared outside a function.

        2)Let: let it is confined to the block in witch it is declared.

        3)Const: const has block scope, similar to let.

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
answer: 1)map(): Transform each element
        of an array based on a function you provide and returns a new array with the transformed values.

        2)forEach(): Executes a provided function once for each element in the array, but does not return anything (it returns undefiend).

        3)filter(): Creates a new array with all the elements that pass a test defined in the provided function.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
answer: Arrow functions in ES6 are a more 
        concise syntax for writing functions in Javascript. They allow to define functions without needing the function keyword and offer a simpler and cleaner way to write function expressions.

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
answer: Destructuring assignment in ES6 is
        a convenient way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variable. it makes code cleaner and easier to understand.

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
answer: 1) Template literals in ES6 are a 
        powerful feature that enhances string handling in JavaScript. They provide a cleaner and more expressive way to work with strings, especially when embedding expressions, multiline strings, and handling string interpolation.

        2) Template literals and string concatenation serve the same purpose of combining strings, but they differ significantly in syntax, readability and flexibility.
